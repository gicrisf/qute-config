#+title: qutebrowser configuration
#+author: Giovanni Crisalfi

A literate qutebrowser configuration made by an Evil Emacs user for space-centered workflows.

The configuration lives inside a single file, the =config.org= file.
Since it's written in org-mode, you can easily tangle with =C-c C-v t= to install everything in the right places.
